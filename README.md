## About Me

I am a second year industrial Ph.D. student at [Technische Universität Dresden ](https://tu-dresden.de/?set_language=en)(TU Dresden) and Huawei Dresden Reserach Center (Huawei DRC), advised by [Dr. Ming Fu](https://brightfu.github.io) and [Prof. Hermann Härtig](http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/~haertig/). Prior to joining TU Dresden, I was a research assistant with [Fan Yang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/fanyang/) and [Mike Chieh-Jan Liang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cmliang/) at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) (MSR Asia, MSRA). I obtained my Master's degree from [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn) (USTC), advised by [Prof. Cheng Li](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~chengli7) and [Prof. Xinyu Feng](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/xyfeng/). Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from USTC, advised by [Dr. Ming Fu](https://brightfu.github.io) and [Prof. Xinyu Feng](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/xyfeng/).

## Research Interests

I am interested in *concurrency*. My research focuses on how to make the program run correctly and fast under a concurrent environment. Specifically, I am interested in *weak consistency models*, *relaxed memory models*, and *concurrent data structures* combined with *formal verification* techniques.
